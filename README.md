The task given was to implement a sort manager program whereby a user through a user input will be able to have a given array of values sorted with whichever one of the three choices given to them. The user is also forced to valid input as input validation is placed in check to manage this. The user is given a choice of either a bubble sort , a merge sort and a binary sort.

# Requirements 
- The user should be able to select any choice of three sort algorithms.
- A random array should be generated for the user to sort as opposed to typing the values themselves
- Input validation should be put in place to ensure only valid input is given to the program.
- The implementaion of the factory design pattern so ensure loose coupling of the code.
